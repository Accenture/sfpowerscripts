# Build & QuickBuild

## What does Build & QuickBuild do?

These commands are useful especially in a mono repo with multiple package directories, to build packages in parallel and by respecting the order to be built. 

## Why should you be using these  Build commands?

These commands provide the following benefits   
 - Reduce time taken to build unlocked packages, by triggering the package creation commands in parallel provided dependencies are built  
-  Reduce efforts in reducing maintenance of builds scripts, when you have multiple packages.

## What's the difference between Build & QuickBuild?

During **quickbuild**, we build unlocked packages without triggering dependency validation or code coverage check. however **build** commands generate fully validated packages that can be deployed to production. Packages generated by **quickbuild** cannot be deployed to production.

We recommend using quickbuild, to generate packages upon every merge and then deploying to your test org's. When you have tested succesfully, you could use the build command to generate a validated packages

## How does Build & QuickBuild  know what to build when using "diffcheck" flag?

TBD

## How does these commands know the order to build?

These commands follow the order of the the packages as ordered in your sfdx-project.json. The commands also read your dependencies property, and then when triggered, will wait till all its dependencies are resolved, before triggering the package creation command. For eg:  provided the followings packages

where B and C is dependent on A, D is dependent on C.  The build commands creates packages in the following order  
 - Trigger creation of package A  
 - Once A is completed, trigger creation of package B & C \(using the version of A, created in step 1\)  
-  Once C is completed, trigger creation of package D

## Does build commands work only for unlocked packages?

No,  build command understand the type of the packages by reading the properties from sfdx-project.json and probing DevHub, to understand whether you have unlocked \(normal and org-dependent\), source and data packages.

## Source and Data packages do not have dependencies, If I have many of these, does it delay building unlocked packages?

Source and Data packages are placed in the queue with a slightly lower priority, as the generation of these commands are faster. Unlocked Packages, with dependencies  are prioritized so that they are able to use the threads.

## Can I skip code coverage check when building dependency validated packages using the 'build' command?

No, we do not provide this option at this stage. Please utilize the artifacts generated by quickbuild for this use ****case.

## **What should be my approach to versioning the packages?**

Utilize the .NEXT and .LATEST for versioning the build number of unlocked packages. For Source and Data package, utilize the "**buildnumber"** flag and provide the build number from your CI/CD system

## **When should I be pushing tags to repo?**

The commands have flags to tag each version of the package and push it to the repo. We recommend you tag every version produced by the "**build"** command, so that when combined with diffcheck, the build times are cut shorted, as only changed packages are built by comparing the commit id of the last tagged version. You could also tag the versions generated by "**quickbuild"** command, however we do not recommend it, as the dependencies have not been validated and you might end up with a non stable set of packages

## I do not want a particular package to be deployed to pooled scratch org's, Is there a way to do it?

Yes, you could use the `ignoreOnStage:[ "build" ]` property to mark which packages should be skipped by the **build** command. Similarly you can use `ignoreOnStage:[ "quickbuild" ]` to skip packages in the quickbuild stage
