# Creates a new  version of  Source Based Package

| Task ID | Latest version |
| :--- | :--- |
| sfpwowerscripts-createsourcepackage-task | 10.0.1 |

This task is used to create a build artifact for a package directory  in your project typically to be used for  org based deployment / pre/post metadata installation of an unlocked package or using a hybrid \(org+unlocked development model\), which can then be associated with a release pipeline. You can read about [`checkout artifact task` ](../deployment-tasks/checkout-a-build-artifact.md)to understand further how both are interrelated.
