# Creates a new  version of  Source Based Package

| Task ID | Latest version |
| :--- | :--- |
| sfpwowerscripts-createsourcepackage-task | 14.0.18 |

At present, Salesforce unlocked package doesn't support packaging of all metadata types, also some metadata are not meant to be deployed using unlocked package \(such as org specific entities\). However to deploy such metadata across multiple org's, one has to resort to deploying metadata directly from a source repo using 'metadata api'. Source based packages is a 'sfpowerscripts' construct that allows one to have the primary advantage of packaging \(mainly traceability, and cohesiveness\) to non packaging supported metadata components.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you are not yet ready with unlocked packages, however would like to get started into the world of package based development, source package will be your primary starting point.
{% endhint %}

This task generates a build artifact which include the source \(metadata\) which will be deployed using the Install Source Package Task.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Source Packages are only traceable from an azure pipelines perspective. On your Salesforce org, it will be treated a normal metadata deployment.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Source Packages like any other metadata deployment requires a unit test coverage of 75% for each classes that is part of the deployment. We recommend you ensure that your package have all the necessary test classes with sufficient coverage for optimal performance. In case it is not possible, switch the flag to 'Deploy via triggering all local tests in the org' in the Install Source Package Task.

Please note this can considerably delay deployments considering how the test classes are written in the org
