# Create a new version of Unlocked Package

| Task ID | Latest Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| sfpwowerscripts-createunlockedpackage-task | 12.0.5 |

This task is used to create a new version of an Unlocked Package. The task can optionally generate a build artifact, containing metadata such as the package ID, name, version, repository URL and the commit ID from which it was generated. The build artifact can then be used in release pipelines to install the associated unlocked package in a Salesforce org. You can read more about unlocked packages [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_dev2gp.htm).

**Prerequisites**

  Calculate and store the code coverage percentage by running the Apex tests included in this package version.

* **Skip Validation of Dependencies,Ancestors etc /** _isValidationToBeSkipped_

  Skips validation of dependencies, package ancestors, and metadata during package version creation. Skipping validation reduces the time it takes to create a new package version, but package versions created without validation canâ€™t be promoted.

* **Config File Path /** _config\_file\_path_

  Path in the current project directory containing config file for the packaging org

* **Bypass Installation Key /** _installationkeybypass_

  Bypass the requirement for having an installation key for this version of the package.
