# Create a Delta Package

| Task ID | Latest Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| sfpwowerscripts-createdeltapackage-task | 6.0.6 |

This task is used to build a changeset \(Delta/Diff between two git commits\) based artifact based on the changes between two commits, which can then be associated with a release pipeline. It is only recommended you utilise a changeset based build process when working on an existing org in the process of refactoring, to eventually utilize modular \(source based/unlocked packaging\) repositories.

This task utilizes the sfpowerkit:project:diff. In case you face any issues with the diff not being accurate, please raise an issue in the [sfpowerkit](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerkit) github repository.

**Prerequisites**

[Install SFDX with Sfpowerkit](../utility-tasks/install-sfdx-cli-with-sfpowerkit.md) task must be added to the pipeline before utilizing this task

{% tab title="Input" %}
Classic Designer Labels are in **Bold,**  YAML Variables are in _italics_

* **Name of the package /** _package_

  Provide a name of the package  

* **The name of the version that needs to be associated with the diff package /**  _version\_name_

  Provide a version name to identify this particular delta/diff when used in the release pipeline.  

* **Revision ID \(Git Commit ID\) from where the diff should baselined on /** _revision\_from_

  Provide the full SHA Commit ID, from where the diff should be generated from  

* **Revision ID \(Git Commit ID\) from where the diff should baselined upto /** _revision\_to_

  Provide the full SHA Commit ID, from where the diff should baselined upto  

* **Generate Destructive Manifest based on the diff /** _generate\_destructivemanifest_

  Check this option to generate a destructive manifest, based on the delta/diff between the provided commits  

* **SFDX Project directory that needs to be deployed /** _project\_directory_

  Leave it blank if the sfdx-project.json is in the root of the repository, else provide the folder directory containing the sfdx-project.json  

* **Set the pipelineâ€™s build number to the the version name mentioned in the task /** _set\_build\_name_

  Check this option if the build number of the pipeline has to match the version name provided in the field version\_name  

* **Create a build artifact with the package id if the delta package creation is successful /** _build\_artifact\_enabled_

  Create a build artifact, so that this pipeline can be consumed by a release pipeline  

* **Bypass directories\*\* /** _bypass\_directories_

  Exclude a comma-separated list of directories from the generated diff.  

* **Generate diff only for the directories mentioned\*\* /** _only\_diff\_for_

* **API version to be used if sfdx-project.json is generated\*\*** / _apiversion_

  Define the API version if a `sfdx-project.json` was generated as part of the the 'Generate diff only for the directories mentioned' parameter.
