| Task Id | Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| sfpwowerscript-checkoutprojectfromartifact-task | 13.3.4 |

This task is used to checkout the code to a particular commit id from a 'git' repo as specified in the artifact produced by any  sfpowerscripts packaging tasks. This task is used in a release pipeline to have access to the code  for utilizing [deploying a package \(source format\) to an org](deploy-a-source-repo-to-org.md) task or any other source manipulations. The repo URL and commit id are already specified in the artifact produced by Packaging Tasks. This task at the moment only authenticating a few git  providers with HTTPS access. There is also an option for authenticating the agent with a preferred method before using this function \(.. already authenticate at the agent level\)

  **- Azure Repo /** _azureRepo_  
   ****Use this if your repository provider is Azure Repo. Please ensure the agent has the right permissions for authenticating to the Azure Repo \( enabled by  '[Allow Scripts to access the OAuth Token'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/options?view=azure-devops#allow-scripts-to-access-the-oauth-token) \)
