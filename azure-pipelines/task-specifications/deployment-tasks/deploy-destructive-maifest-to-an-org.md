# Deploy Destructive Maifest to an org

| Task Id | Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| sfpwowerscript-deploydestructivemanifest-task | 5.0.0 |

  
This task is a wrapper over sfpowerkit:org:destruct \([link](https://github.com/Accenture/sfpowerkit)\). This is a helper task to delete metadata from an org using path to a destructive changeset \(destructiveChanges.xml\)  or by mentioning the contents in a multiline text field.

> This  task is typically used in standalone release pipeline to orchestrate deletion of metadata across multiple sandboxes or used along with [Create a Delta Package task](../packaging-tasks/create-a-delta-package.md) which produces the destructive changes

**Prerequisites**

[Install SFDX CLI with sfpowerkit](../utility-tasks/install-sfdx-cli-with-sfpowerkit.md) task must be added to the pipeline before utilizing this task
