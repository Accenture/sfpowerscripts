# Deploy

## What does deploy command do?

Given a directory of artifacts and a target org, the **deploy** command will deploy the packages to the target org according to the sequence defined in the project configuration file.

The **deploy** command removes the overhead of scripting individual package deployments. The packages to deploy and order of deployment is automatically decoded from the project configuration file carried inside the packages \(From Release 19\)

{% hint style="info" %}
For the deploy command to work, the artifacts must be created from the same source respository
{% endhint %}

## What are the sequence of steps the deploy command does?

The deploy command runs through the following steps

* Reads all the sfpowerscripts packages provided through the artifact directory  
* Unzips the artifacts and finds the latest sfdx-project.json.ori  to determine the deployment order, if this particular file is not found \(if the artifact is built from an earlier sfpowerscripts build/create - Release 18 or below\), it needs sfdx-project.json on the repo  
* Install the packages from the provided artifact directory to the target org based on the deployment order

## How do I skip a package from being deployed to an org?

Yes, you could use the `ignoreOnStage:[ "deploy" ]` property to mark which packages should be skipped by the deploy command. If you want a selective skip, that is skip a particular package being deployed to specific org, your could use the property `skipDeployOnOrgs: ["username/alias","username/alias"]` . If the username/alias passed as a flag to the command matches the array, then this package will be skipped on deployment

## What if I need to deploy a package everytime?

There are some certain situations, due to integrity concerns \(especially around data or org-specific source packages\) that need to be installed every time, as some earlier packages if deployed in the sequence would overwrite certain components. To solve this specific challenge utilize `alwaysDeploy:true` and the particular package will always be deployed. **Please note this package has to be always available in the artifacts directory to make it work.**

## I want a non-linear pipeline, how can deploy help?

It is often a recommended practice to split CI/CD into [asynchronous pipelines](https://worklifenotes.com/2020/06/04/7-best-practices-modern-cicd/). In this particular pattern, CI pipelines are responsible for uploading artifacts into an artifact repository \( eg: Jfrog Artifactory, Azure Artifacts\) and CD pipelines then deploys these artifacts.

In this particular instance, this is a rough schematic for designing such pipelines are as follows. As you could see, from the below diagram, deploy could be used in the CD pipelines using only the artifacts from the artifact repository without the need for version control system to be hooked into the CD pipelines.

## What does the `--baselineorg` parameter do?

The `--baselineorg` parameter allows you to specify the alias or username of an org against which to check whether the incoming package versions have already been installed and form a deployment plan.This overrides the default behaviour which is to compare against the deployment target org. This is an optional feature which allows to ensure each org's are updated with the same deployment across every org's in the path to production.
