# General Questions

## Why are some of the task names begin with "sfpwowerscripts"?

It was an early typo that has not fully been depreciated. The initial focus of azure pipelines extension was classic/ui based and this was hidden in internal details. However YAML pipelines has exposed this nasty typo. We are working on it and hope that this question will one day be able to be depreciated.
