# Troubleshooting

## Why do I get InvalidPackageDirectory error during validation and deployment tasks?

**Stage:** Validation, Deployment  
 **Build Task:** Deploy a Source Directory \(Source Format\) to an Org  


```text
sfpowerscripts... Deploy Source to Org
Converting source to mdapi
Converting to MDAPI Format force-app in project directory
ERROR running force:source:convert:  InvalidPackageDirectory
Unable to convert source for directory force-app
##[error]Command failed: npx sfdx force:source:convert -r force-app  -d QTcO4_mdapi
ERROR running force:source:convert:  InvalidPackageDirectory
```

**Possible Resolution:**   
 Check that all your defined packages in `sfdx-project.json` has at least 1 file in the package directory so that the `sfdx cli` detects that the package exists and is valid. During the mdapi conversion process, it will reference the `sfdx-project.json` file before starting to convert the specified package.
